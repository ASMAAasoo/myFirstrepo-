A Brief introduction about myself :
Hello! My name is Asmaa El Ouakifi, 
and I am a passionate athlete with a deep love for various sports,
including football, basketball, volleyball, and gym workouts. 
As a first-year web development student, I am excited to blend my technical skills with my enthusiasm for sports.
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences, which drives me to connect with others and share my training journey. 
Whether on the court, field, or in the gym, I thrive on teamwork and the joy of pushing my limits. 
I'm looking forward to inspiring and being inspired by fellow sports enthusiasts!
